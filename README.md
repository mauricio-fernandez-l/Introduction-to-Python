## Installation

1. Install "miniconda" (minimal version of anaconda distribution) with latest Python version

     <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>

2. In Windows, go to start and open up "Anaconda prompt (miniconda3)"
3. Install packages with

        conda install [package name]

    Install the following packages

     * numpy
     * matplotlib
     * tensorflow (only if you want to work with Machine Learning stuff)
     * spyder

4. Open spyder (IDE: integrated development environment) through start in Windows

     * Use console (right, bottom) to run simple commands
     * Use editor (left) to write scripts (set of commands in `.py` files) and run them with F5 in the console

5. **[Optional]** Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for an even more powerful IDE

     * Make sure to select option "Add open folder with VS Code" during installation
     * Go to market place and install "Python extension for Visual Studio Code"
     * make `cmd` default terminal
